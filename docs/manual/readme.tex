\section{X-Space (release 7)}

X-Space is an aerospace simulator based on X-Plane flight simulator. It is available as a plugin, and as a dedicated server (for calculating spaceflight), also as an Orbiter space simulator addon (to provide networking).

\section{Features}
(new features in \textbf{bold})

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Provides information about partial concentrations and densities of atmospheric gases}
  \item \textbf{Clouds visible from orbit (procedural clouds based on realtime weather)}
  \item \textbf{Different visual effects based on fuel used in the rocket engine}
  \item \textbf{Detailed engine performance simulation (variation in thrust with external pressure)}
  \item \textbf{Support for multiple stages/multi-part vessels}
  \item \textbf{Visual effects from heating (glow due to heat radiation)}
  \item \textbf{Earth gravitational field simulation (non-spherical gravity based on EGM96 model)}
  \item \textbf{Support for extra fuel tanks (or additional weights)}
  \item Orbital flight simulation (uses custom physics engine to override X-Plane physics at high altitudes)
  \item Detailed atmospheric model (including exosphere, high-altitude atmospheric drag)
  \item Atmospheric scattering visible from orbit (for X-Plane 9, X-Plane 10 without HDR)
  \item Support for any amount of custom engines (reaction control engines, additional rocket engines)
  \item Advanced networking support (multiplayer)
  \item Fuselage drag simulation (drag from capsules, hypersonic vessels)
  \item Heating simulation (covers a wide range of external pressures and velocities)
  \item Earth magnetic field simulation (fairly precise magnetic field data from WMM)
  \item Material simulation (simulates properties of various materials the spacecraft is constructed from)
  \item Extra camera views (relative to vessel reference point, vessel center of mass)
  \item Vertical launch pads
  \item Simulates planet rotation
  \item Publishes a large amount of variables (datarefs) accessible by other plugins
\end{itemize}

\section{Installing}
\textbf{Please remove the old version of X-Space if it's present}

Just copy contents of folders in this archive into corresponding folders in X-Plane 9 (or X-Plane 10) folder. The folders must be \textit{merged} together (not replaced!).

To uninstall it just delete the following folders:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \reg{$\backslash$X-Plane 9$\backslash$Resources$\backslash$plugins$\backslash$x-space}
  \item \reg{$\backslash$X-Plane 9$\backslash$Aircraft$\backslash$XSAG}
\end{itemize}
